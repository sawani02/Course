#### Data : 
Data is taken from sklearn's make_moon dataset. There are two features and and the target is a categorical variable (0/1). The aim is to devise an algorithm that correctly classifies the datapoints. Here is the link to the data set:

#### Aproach: 
You will build a TensorFlow neural networks Program from first principles
