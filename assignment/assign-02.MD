Computing regression parameters using 

1) Closed Form (Usin linear algebra) 
2) Gradient Descent 

Consider the following 5 point synthetic data set:

X: 0,1,2,3,4
Y: 1,3,7,13,21

We want the line that “best fits” this data set as measured by residual sum of squares

Answer: slope = 5, intercept = -1
